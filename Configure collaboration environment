Our current setup allows teams to collaborate in slack while getting notifications in their channel about things that happen 
in their GitHub repo or on their Trello board.

Setup instructions for Slack + Trello + GitHub:

Creating spaces:
1. create slack channel - private / public
2. create GitHub repo
3. create Trello board
Configuring spaces:
4. in slack channel press settings -> add apps. make sure "Trello alerts" and "GitHub" and "Kyber" are installed.
5. in the settings of the Trello alerts app, "add configuration" and set it to receive alerts from the correct board into the correct channel
6. in github repo that is subscribed to slack, go to settings -> integrations & services -> configure (slack) -> select repositories -> selcet repository to connect with slack -> save
7. in team channel write “/github subscribe [github organization name]/[repo name]” to add notifications from the selected repo
